## Setup

Members are free to use their preferred IDE, text editors, compilers, and/or dev-environment.

### Linux/MacOS

Those of you using Linux/MacOS, you'll just have to figure it out yourself,
like you do with everything else about your computer.

### Windows 

To those who are new and need something that "just works" then I
suggest using [Dev-C++](http://www.bloodshed.net/) (an Open Source C/C++ IDE
for Windows).
